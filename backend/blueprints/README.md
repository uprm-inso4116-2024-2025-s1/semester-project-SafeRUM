# Accessing the `/docs` Route in All Blueprints

This project provides a `/docs` route for every registered blueprint to access API documentation generated by Flask-AutoDoc. Follow these steps to access and interact with the documentation.

---

## Prerequisites

1. Ensure the application is running. You can start the application with:
   ```bash
   flask run
   ```

2. Note the base URL where the application is running:
   - Default: `http://127.0.0.1:5000`
   - Custom (if using a different port or host): Replace `127.0.0.1:5000` with your custom host and port.

## Accessing `/docs`

1. **Global Overview:**
   Each blueprint in the application has a `/docs` route, which lists all the endpoints defined within that blueprint.

2. **Blueprint-Specific Documentation:**
   - Navigate to the `/docs` endpoint for the blueprint you want to explore.
   - Example for a blueprint called `admin`:
     ```bash
     http://127.0.0.1:5000/admin/docs
     ```

3. **How to Use:**
   - Open a web browser or use a tool like `curl` or Postman to view the generated documentation.
   - Example using `curl`:
     ```bash
     curl http://127.0.0.1:5000/admin/docs
     ```

4. **Documentation Format:**
   - The `/docs` route provides a plain HTML or JSON representation of the available routes, including:
     - **HTTP Methods:** (e.g., `GET`, `POST`)
     - **Endpoint URLs**
     - **Optional/Required Parameters**
     - **Descriptions** (if provided in the code comments)

## Example Blueprints and Routes

Below are some example blueprints and how to access their `/docs` routes:

| Blueprint Name | `/docs` Route Example              |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| `admin`        | `http://127.0.0.1:5000/admin/docs` |
| `user`         | `http://127.0.0.1:5000/user/docs`  |
| `auth`         | `http://127.0.0.1:5000/auth/docs`  |

## Troubleshooting

1. **404 Not Found:**
   - Ensure the blueprint is registered correctly in the application.
   - Verify the URL matches the blueprint's registered prefix.

2. **Empty or Missing Documentation:**
   - Confirm that the routes in the blueprint are properly decorated and registered for AutoDoc to include them.
   - Example of proper route decoration:
     ```python
     @auto.doc()
     @admin_bp.route('/example', methods=['GET'])
     def example_route():
         """This is an example route."""
         return "Example response"
     ```
